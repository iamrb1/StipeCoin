 StipeCoin CryptoCurrency Sepolia Test Network

First time using solidity to create a smart contract developed upon the ERC20 token with basic crypotcurrency functions. As being developed on the ERC20 token, it is possible to deploy to the Etherium Blockchain; however, I deployed it to the (now depreciated) rinkeby test network with plans to deploy to sepolia instead.
