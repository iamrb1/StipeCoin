# StipeCoin
 StipeCoin CryptoCurrency Sepolia Test Network

First time using solidity to create a smart contract developed upon the ERC20 token with basic crypotcurrency functions. As being developed on the ERC20 token, it is possible to deploy to the Etherium Blockchain; however, I deployed it to the (now depreciated) rinkeby test network with plans to deploy to sepolia instead.

To recreate, please create your own .env file and make sure to add in your Infura API key (your project key), as well as your metamask private key.
